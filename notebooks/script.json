        {"slide": 1, "title": "Title Slide", "script": "Welcome everyone! Today we're going to dive into a fascinating but often misunderstood trio of conditions: Catatonia, Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome, and Serotonin Syndrome. These are conditions that every clinician needs to know about, as they can be life-threatening if not recognized and treated promptly. I'm Dr. Celano, and I'll be guiding you through this important topic."},
        {"slide": 2, "title": "Disclosure", "should_skip": true, "script": "Just a quick note about disclosures - I have a speaking and teaching relationship with Sunovion Pharmaceuticals, but this isn't directly relevant to today's presentation. Transparency is important in medical education, so I always like to start with this."},
        {"slide": 3, "title": "How common is catatonia?", "script": "Now, let's talk about how common catatonia really is. You might be surprised to learn that it's not as rare as you might think! We're looking at a prevalence rate of 7.8-9.0%, which is actually quite significant. What's particularly interesting is where we tend to see it most - it's actually more common in medical settings than psychiatric ones. Think about that for a moment - you're more likely to encounter catatonia on a medical floor than in a psychiatric unit!\nHere's something that might surprise you - up to 46% of catatonia cases aren't primarily psychiatric at all. They're due to medical conditions! This is why it's so crucial for all of us, regardless of our specialty, to know how to recognize and manage this condition.\nAnd for those of you who work with older adults, pay special attention - the prevalence is notably higher in this population. When you're dealing with elderly patients who present with unusual behavioral symptoms, catatonia should definitely be on your differential."},
        {"slide": 4, "title": "When are you called?", "script": "Let me share something that every resident should know - the 'POSSUM' mnemonic. When nurses call you about a patient who's 'playing possum,' your catatonia radar should immediately activate. This is actually a brilliant accidental mnemonic because it captures the key presentations perfectly:\nP - Perseveration: The patient might repeat the same words or movements\nO - Oppositionality: They resist all requests, even simple ones\nS - Speech that trails off or becomes whispered\nS - Slowed responses to questions or commands\nU - Undernourished (decreased oral intake)\nM - Motionless but awake\nIsn't it fascinating how these symptoms can mimic someone 'playing dead' like a possum? But remember, this isn't a game - these patients aren't 'faking it.' They're experiencing a very real neuropsychiatric condition."},
        {"slide": 5, "title": "Diagnosing Catatonia: DSM-5", "script": "Now, let's get into the formal diagnostic criteria. The DSM-5 makes it relatively straightforward - you need 3 or more symptoms from a list of 12. Think of it as a 'pick 3' menu, but one you definitely don't want to be ordering from!\nLet me make these symptoms more memorable. We can group them into three categories:\n\nMovement abnormalities: catalepsy (like a wax figure), posturing, and stereotypies\nInteractive symptoms: negativism, mutism, and echolalia/echopraxia (the 'mimicking' symptoms)\nBehavioral presentations: agitation, grimacing, and mannerisms\n\nThe beauty of understanding these groupings is that if you spot one symptom from a category, it should prompt you to look for others in that same group. It's like being a detective - one clue leads you to look for related ones!"},
        {"slide": 6, "title": "Bush-Francis Rating Scale", "script": "The Bush-Francis Rating Scale is like the Swiss Army knife of catatonia assessment. It's more comprehensive than the DSM-5 criteria, and I find it particularly useful for tracking a patient's progress over time.\nWhat's fascinating about this scale is how it captures subtleties that might otherwise be missed. For instance, you'll notice some intriguing terms here like 'Mitgehen' and 'Gegenhalten.' Let me bring these to life for you:\nMitgehen is German for 'going with' - imagine your patient's arm feeling like it's magnetized to your hand, following your movements despite you telling them not to. It's quite different from Gegenhalten, which means 'counterholding' - where the patient provides resistance proportional to the force you apply. These subtle distinctions can be crucial for diagnosis.\nI particularly love teaching about 'automatic obedience' because it's almost like a neurological magic trick - the patient might automatically follow commands even while appearing otherwise unresponsive. It's a perfect example of how complex and paradoxical catatonia can be.\n"},
        {"slide": 7, "title": "Challenges with Diagnosis", "script": "Now, let's get real about the challenges we face in diagnosing catatonia. The biggest hurdle? These symptoms exist on a spectrum, and they can be devilishly tricky to differentiate.\nThink about trying to distinguish between rigidity, gegenhalten, and negativism. It's like trying to tell the difference between three shades of blue in dim lighting - they can look remarkably similar at first glance. That's why I always encourage my residents to spend time really observing and examining these patients.\nThe inconsistency between scales can also be frustrating. It's like having different GPS systems giving you slightly different routes to the same destination. Which one do you follow? This is where clinical judgment becomes crucial, and why experience in examining these patients is so valuable.\nRemember, catatonia is like a chameleon - it can present in countless ways. That's why we need to keep our diagnostic lens wide and our clinical suspicion high.\n"},
        {"slide": 8, "title": "Prototypes of Catatonia", "script": "This is one of my favorite slides to teach because it breaks catatonia into four distinct 'characters' that you'll encounter in clinical practice. Think of these as the main characters in a play - each with their own unique presentation.\nFirst, we have 'The Distant Mute.' Picture a patient who appears completely disconnected from their environment, like they're trapped behind an invisible wall. The fascinating thing about these patients is that the medical team often thinks they're being deliberately uncooperative. But remember - this is a neuropsychiatric condition, not a choice.\nThen there's 'The Waxy Stiff.' These patients demonstrate that remarkable phenomenon of maintaining whatever position you place them in, like a poseable figure. What's particularly interesting is that physicians often recognize something's wrong here, but might mistakenly attribute it purely to psychiatric illness.\n'The Broken Record' is our third character. These patients show repetitive behaviors and speech patterns that can be mistaken for delirium. It's a crucial distinction because the treatment approaches differ significantly.\nFinally, we have 'The Stubborn Grouch.' These patients are often the most challenging because their negativism and excitement can make it difficult to complete a proper medical workup. It's a bit like trying to examine a cat that doesn't want to be examined - except here, it's not willful resistance but a symptom of their condition.\nWhat makes these prototypes so valuable is that they help us recognize patterns. When you see these presentations, it should trigger your catatonia radar, prompting a more thorough evaluation.\n"},
        {"slide": 9, "title": "Pathophysiology of Catatonia", "script": "Now, let's dive into the fascinating neurobiology of catatonia. Picture the brain as a complex highway system, where the basal ganglia are like major traffic control centers. In catatonia, there's a disruption in the roads connecting these control centers to different parts of the cortex.\nThe key player here is dopamine - or rather, the lack of it. It's like having too few traffic officers directing the flow of vehicles. This disruption affects different 'neighborhoods' of the brain in distinct ways:\nThe dorsolateral prefrontal and anterior cingulate regions, when affected, lead to that striking akinetic mutism and autonomic dysfunction. Think of it as a power outage in the brain's command center.\nThe lateral orbitofrontal disruption explains those peculiar imitative and repetitive behaviors - it's as if the brain's 'copy and paste' function gets stuck in a loop.\nAnd when the supplementary motor areas are involved, we see those characteristic movement abnormalities. It's like having a faulty control system for the body's motor functions.\nWhat I find particularly fascinating is how this understanding has evolved from theoretical models to concrete neurobiological findings. It helps explain why certain treatments work and gives us clues about what to try when standard approaches fail.\n"},
